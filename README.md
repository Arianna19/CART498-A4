**Project Report: Jugian Dream Interpreter Chat Box**<br>
This assignment asked to design and deploy a web-based dream interpreter tool that analyzes the submitted dreams and generates both a textual and visual interpretation of the dream from the user. The objective was to use Carl Jung's analytical psychology with AI models in a way that's interactive, fun and visually engaging for the users. 

**Jungian Theory Prompt Design**<br>
From what's online, Jung sees dreams as messages from the unconscious, that are shown through symbols, archetypes and reccuring imagery. To accomplish this the best I could, text prompt was designed to guide the AI towards those specific concepts like archetypes, symbolic setting and process individuation. It was difficult to fiddle with the prompt since it had super strict guidelines in terms of coding. Hence, keeping it as simple and short as possible was the best route to take for the AI. Less was more in for the prompting, also due to memory issues. Doing so, the AI produces symbolic, meaningful interpretations and mentions potential inner conflicts or balances the dream from the user shows. 
The image generation portion simply puts the dream description in a symbolic visual scene with some surrealism. This matches Jung's theory of dreams being a metaphor taken from the unconscious.
